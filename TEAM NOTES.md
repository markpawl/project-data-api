# Notes for WebAge team

All the student file hinting that I ended up doing is in project-data-api:

* Did not touch the React client - my understanding is that we don't ask the students to create this anyway
* Did not touch project-auth-api - it appears to be pretty much the same as project-data-api but with authorizations, right?  If that's the case, we could re-use the sample files from project-data-api, correct?

Additionally, I did not touch the JWT material - I don't know how it works so I'm not comfortable suggesting what should or should not be in the student template.
